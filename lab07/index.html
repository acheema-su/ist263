        My name is Abdur Cheema.I am an undergraduate at Syracuse University. I recently switched my major from computer science to <strong>Information Management & Technology</strong> at I-school. I am interested in IM&T because I want to focus on the web development part of the technology.

        In high school, I was the NYC city-wide hackathon <strong>champion</strong> for 2019. I have also interned at NBC where I worked as a marketing intern and at Bloomberg where I learned my first programming language python. In my free time, I like to play cricket with my friends.
