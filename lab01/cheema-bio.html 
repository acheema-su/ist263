        My name is Abdur Cheema.I am an undergraduate at Syracuse University. I recently switched my major from computer science to Information Management & Technology at I-school. I am interested in IM&T because I want to focus on the web development part of the technology. In high school, I was the NYC city-wide hackathon champion for 2019. I have also interned at NBC where I worked as a marketing intern and at Bloomberg where I learned my first programming language python. In my free time, I like to play cricket with my friends. I grew up in Pakistan where I spent 14 years of my life. I immigrated to the United States when I was 14 and started high school in NYC.
