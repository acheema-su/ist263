   <p>My name is Abdur Cheema.I am an undergraduate at Syracuse University. <br> I recently switched my major from computer science to Information Management & Technology at I-school. <br> I am interested in IM&T because I want to focus on the web development part of the technology. <br>

In high school, I was the NYC city-wide hackathon champion for 2019. <br> I have also interned at NBC where I worked as a marketing intern and at Bloomberg where I learned my first programming language python. <br> In my free time, I like to play cricket with my friends.</p> <br>
